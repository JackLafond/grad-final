	<p>This project aims to understand which visualization techniques are best suited for analyzing NFL draft data. We used various visualizations such as hive plots, small multiples, and bubble hierarchies to understand which college conferences produce the best NFL prospects. Our data was comprised of the wikipedia NFL draft data from the years 2010 to 2020. For each player drafted we also stored their various NFL accolades like number of Pro Bowls, Super Bowl wins, First and Second Team All Pros, and others. We used these accolades to assess overall player success in the NFL.</p> 
	<p>Our web page includes an introductory guide to hive plots, our overall draft analysis, and a page dedicated to displaying some of the visualization techniques we implemented but ultimately did not use in our analysis. These can be accessed via the navigation menu.</p>
	<p>This project builds off of a previous project which implemented a Sankey diagram to understand NFL draft pipelines. The project can be found here: <a href="https://bradya25.github.io/final/">Link to Previous Project</a></p>
